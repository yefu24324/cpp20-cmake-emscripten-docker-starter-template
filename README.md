C++20 CMake-Emscripten Template
===============================

*Setup for **Native** and **Web** build of **C++20** source code.*

ü§î Why this repository?
-----------------------

**Problem:** There is currently an issue when using C++20 with Emscripten's `emcmake` ([emscripten#22305](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/22305)). There is a fix proposed in [PR#21987](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/21987), but it has not been merged yet.

**Solution:** This repository provides a minimal setup that **imports the fix** proposed by [PR#21987](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/21987) **without the need to modify emscripten** itself.

**Enhancements:** Building on the original project, we've added Docker support that allows developers to quickly build the project using simple Docker commands, eliminating the need for complex environment setup. Additionally, we've included several example functions to help newcomers learn how to use C++20 with WebAssembly.

ü•∏ Using as a template
---------------------

You may use this repository as a template, then replace the following strings in the code base:

 - `my_project` is the name of the CMake project (and IDE solution).
 - `my_target` is the name of the CMake target, i.e., the name of the generated executable or HTML file.

üèóÔ∏è Building
-----------

This is a regular CMake project, that builds like a CMake project. The **only exception** is the extra option needed for Web build (see below).

These instructions show how to manually call CMake, but a `CMakePresets.json` file is also provided as an alternative.

### Building with Docker (Recommended)

The simplest way is to use Docker, without installing any dependencies:

```bash
# One command to build the project and generate JavaScript/WebAssembly files
docker compose up --remove-orphans
```

This command automatically sets up all necessary environments and compiles the project using Emscripten, producing files that can be run directly in a browser.

### Native

```bash
# Configure
cmake -B build-native
# or 'cmake --preset native'

# Build
cmake --build build-native

# Run (Windows & MSVC)
build/src/Debug/my_target.exe

# Run (other)
build/src/my_target
```

### WebAssembly

**NB** *The workaround for issue [emscripten#22305](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/22305) consists in pointing `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_CLANG_SCAN_DEPS` to the local fix that we have in `cmake/EmscriptenScanDepsFix`.*

```bash
# Activate emscripten env (Windows)
C:/path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.bat

# Activate emscripten env (other)
. /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh

# Configure
emcmake cmake -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_CLANG_SCAN_DEPS=cmake/EmscriptenScanDepsFix/emscan-deps
# or 'emcmake cmake --preset web'

# Build
cmake --build build

# Host
python -m http.server 8000
# The browse to http://localhost:8000/build-web/src/my_target.html
```

üìö Example Functions
-----------

To help newcomers get started quickly, we've added several example functions that demonstrate how C++20 and WebAssembly can work together:

- JavaScript/C++ data passing examples
- C++20 new features in WebAssembly
- DOM manipulation examples
- Asynchronous function call examples

These example functions come with detailed comments and can serve as a reference for developers learning and practicing.
